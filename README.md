 Healthcare EDA Project:

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world hospital admission dataset. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from patient data using Python and data visualization libraries.

 Objectives:

 Understand patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
 Analyze types of hospital admissions
 Identify most common diagnoses
 Explore patterns like room assignment (assumed), repeat patients, and admission day trends
 Visualize key findings using plots

Tools & Libraries Used:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

 Key Insights:

Emergency admissions   were the most frequent mode of entry.
The   41–80 age group   had the highest admission rate.
Heart Failure   and   STEMI   were among the most common diagnoses.
A small percentage of patients were   repeat visitors   based on their MRD number.
Room types were   approximated   using ICU and stay duration data.
